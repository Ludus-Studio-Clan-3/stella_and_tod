## Overview

In *Stella and the Threads of Dawn*, the night sky is unraveling — its constellations dimming as the stories that hold them together are forgotten.
You play as **Stella**, a young wanderer who journeys across distant lands to help their guardians remember and reweave the fading myths of their people.

Developed by **Ludus Studio**, this project explores **cultural memory, empathy, and storytelling through interactive play**.

> 🧵 *This project was bootstrapped from [Threadbare](https://github.com/endlessm/threadbare), an open-source narrative learning game by Endless Access. We thank the Threadbare team for inspiring the initial scaffolding, open development practices, and story-creation framework that shaped the foundation of StoryQuest.*
