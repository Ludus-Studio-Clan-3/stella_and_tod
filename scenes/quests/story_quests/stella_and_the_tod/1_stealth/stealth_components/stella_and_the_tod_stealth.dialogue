The Fog-Teller’s valley is carved into jagged stone tonight. Darkness pools between the cliffs and broken rock corridors, turning the rugged maze into shifting silhouettes. Somewhere within its winding crags lies a single silver Thread—a fragment of a story long forgotten.

Your task is simple, yet perilous: navigate the rocky maze, stay hidden, and reclaim the Thread before the watchers of the cliffs detect you. These guardians, shaped from the Fog-Teller’s fading memories, prowl the narrow paths with sharpened senses. If they spot you, the valley resets, and the Thread slips deeper into the dark.

Move quietly. Use the shadows and stone outcrops as cover. Let intuition guide your steps through the labyrinth.
Find the Thread. Restore the memory. Become unseen.

=> END
